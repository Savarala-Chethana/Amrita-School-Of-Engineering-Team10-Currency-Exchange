Problem Statement:-
Create a dashboard which will allow users to analyze the exchange rates between two currencies 
over a period of time. Users should have the option to select weekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly 
charts. The dashboard should also display the date on which the rate was at its peak (highest) and 
the date on which it was at its lowest. Users should be able to print the data in a chart. Input will be 
currency exchange rate dataset between a currency pair and will be provided in a file format
Use USD as Base Currency where first currency will always be USD and second currency will be 
variable. For instance, currency pairs could be USD/INR, USD/GBP, USD/EUR, USD/CAD etc.

Functional tasks:-
(1)Read and store the data from file. (2) Create a use interface which allows users to select currency and desired duration. Users 
should have the ability to switch between weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annual charts. 
(3) Fetch data for given currency and time duration. Show the trend over a given period. Also 
display the date on which the rate was highest with the actual rate and date on which the 
rate was lowest along with the rate
